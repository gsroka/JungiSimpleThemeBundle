JungiSimpleThemeBundle
================

The bundle was only created to demonstrate how themes works in the Symfony2. Of course this is a minimal theme without
any super logic and it's used in [JungiSimpleEnvironmentBundle](http://test.pl) which it's a great example how themes
can cooperate with the Symfony2.
